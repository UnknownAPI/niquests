**Niquests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. It is a drop-in replacement for **Requests**, which is under feature freeze.

Niquests, is the “**Safest**, **Fastest[^10]**, **Easiest**, and **Most advanced**” Python HTTP Client. Production Ready!

_Scenario:_ Fetch a thousand requests using 10 tasks or threads, each with a hundred requests using a single pool of connection.

Did you give up on HTTP/2 due to performance concerns? Think again! Do you realize that you can get 3 times faster with the same CPU if you ever switched to Niquests from Requests?
Multiplexing and response lazyness open up a wide range of possibilities! Want to learn more about the tests? scripts? reasoning?

```python
>>> import niquests
>>> r = niquests.get('https://one.one.one.one')

or using async/await!
```python
import niquests
import asyncio

async def main() -> None:
    r = await niquests.aget('https://one.one.one.one', stream=True)
    print(r)  # Output: <Response HTTP/2 [200]>
    payload = await r.text  # we await text because we set `stream=True`!
    print(payload)  # Output: <html>...
    # or... without stream=True
    r = await niquests.aget('https://one.one.one.one')
    print(r)  # Output: <Response HTTP/3 [200]>
    payload = r.text  # we don't need to away anything, it's already loaded!
    print(payload)  # Output: <html>...

asyncio.run(main())
```

Niquests allows you to send HTTP requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — just use the `json` method!

## 📝 Why did we pursue this?

For many years now, **Requests** has been frozen. Being left in a vegetative state and not evolving, this blocked millions of developers from using more advanced features.

We don't have to reinvent the wheel all over again, HTTP client **Requests** is well established and
really pleasant in its usage. We believe that **Requests** has the most inclusive and developer friendly interfaces.
We intend to keep it that way. As long as we can, long live Niquests!

How about a nice refresher with a mere `CTRL+H` _import requests_ **to** _import niquests as requests_ ?

## 💼 For Enterprise

Professional support for Niquests is available as part of the [Tidelift
Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-niquests?utm_source=pypi-niquests&utm_medium=readme). Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for
purchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances
from the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing
tools.

Niquests is a highly improved HTTP client that is based (forked) on Requests. The previous project original author is Kenneth Reitz and actually left the maintenance of Requests years ago.

[^1]: aiohttp was conceived solely for an asynchronous context.
[^2]: requests has no support for asynchronous request.
[^3]: while the HTTP/2 connection object can handle concurrent requests, you cannot leverage its true potential.
[^4]: loading client certificate without file can't be done.
[^5]: httpx officially claim to be thread safe but recent tests demonstrate otherwise as of february 2024. https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/83#issuecomment-1956065258 https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3072 https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3002 and only recently acknowledged the issue in https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3324 (one year after getting valid reports).
[^6]: they do not expose anything to control network aspects such as IPv4/IPv6 toggles, and timings (e.g. DNS response time, established delay, TLS handshake delay, etc...) and such.
[^7]: while advertised as possible, they refuse to make it the default due to performance issues. as of October 2024 an extra is required to enable it manually.
[^8]: they don't support HTTP/3 at all.
[^9]: you must use a custom DNS resolver so that it can preemptively connect using HTTP/3 over QUIC when remote is compatible.
[^10]: performance measured when leveraging a multiplexed connection with or without uses of any form of concurrency as of October 2024. The research compared `httpx`, `requests`, `aiohttp` against `niquests`. See https://github.com/Ousret/niquests-stats
[^11]: enabled when using a custom DNS resolver.
[^12]: available only when using HTTP/3 over QUIC and that the remote server support also the same post-quantum key-exchange algorithm. Also, the `qh3` installed version must be >= 1.1.
[^13]: most servers out there are not ready for this feature, but Niquests is already compliant and future-proof! [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.9.0) server and [HAProxy](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy) support this!
[^14]: they don't offer any built-in to speak with a WebSocket server.
